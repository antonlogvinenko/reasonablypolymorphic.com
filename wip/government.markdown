[Scott Alexander][scott] somewhat famously has a tag for posts on his blog
entitled "things I will regret writing". If you've read any of his work,
hopefully it's no surprise to you that Scott is someone I aspire to be more
like. Today's post is something I'd tag as such if "things I will regret
writing" would fit in my tag bar above. Since it won't, I'll have to play fast
and loose when it comes publishing time.

Nevertheless, NaBloWriMo waits for no man, let alone [regret][shame], let alone
regret that hasn't even happened yet. And so with as much reluctance as ever,
let's talk about politics today.

[Some politicians are crooked][crooked]. Yes, I know it's shocking and a lot of
information to take in all at once, but hear me out.

[crooked]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_political_scandals

talk about:
too much money for too few qualifications
if you wanted to design a system more amenable to corruption you would be hard
pressed to
meritocracy and markets (caitlin's post)
mechanism design
this is probably solvable in principle
