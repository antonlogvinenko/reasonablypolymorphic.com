An amazing thing just happened.

This was the author's note postfixed to a highly-anticipated chapter of the
absolutely fantastic [hpmor][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality], an
epic[^1] piece of fan-fiction whose episodic chapters have been continuously
published over the last five years. I usually describe HPMoR as "imagine if Harry
Potter were an extraordinarily intelligent scientist before attending Hogwarts".
That tag-line really doesn't do justice to the work, but it pretty accurately
describes what you'll be getting into for the first dozen chapters or so.

[^1]: This is not a word I use lightly.

So as to spoil as little as possible for you, I won't discuss the Final Exam in
any detail, suffice to say that Harry finds himself in a position where certain
death will occur in 60 seconds. He is unable to talk his way out of it (his
usual approach to problems throughout the series), unable to perform magic, has
no magic items on his person, and is known by nobody to be in any trouble
whatsoever.

Not a good spot to be in.

This post, however, is not about how Harry manages to wiggle his way out of the
problem; instead it is the story of how HPMoR's readers banded together and
systematically *crushed* the Final Exam.

talk about committing to contribute more?

strategy:
  - somehow, without anyone named as the central leader, organization happened
  - somebody wrote a script to rip all of the data off of ff.net
  - this was put into a google doc, but not in canonical order
    - first attempts at canonicalizing this were done by hand, and required to be double checked
    - not sure if this was automated, but i assume it was because when i checked back 6 hours later it was all done
  - another google doc was created in an attempt to "deduplicate" the results
    - 2000 rows, one with the name of each poster.
    - columns for "major idea", "minor idea", and a brief synopsis
    - color was used to highlight things as being "novel", "agreed upon solution", "funny", "impossible" or "not a solution", for quick scanning
  - the plan was for people to pick a section of the doc, and start filling it in, xrefing against the data doc
    - and updating the master list of major/minor ideas as you found novel ones
    - some excell wizards managed to make the doc count categorized solutions, and to determine what percentage of the doc had been categorized
  - originally the classification effort was a big validation effort
    - "is this solution worthy?"
    - by the time i got to it, there were huge warnings everywhere saying "DO NOT JUDGE, JUST REVIEW IT IN A SENTENCE AND MARK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FEASIBLE"
  - i resolved at the beginning of this year to start contributing to endeavours i thought valuable
    - and i had been making pretty shit progress towards that so far
    - but the final exam explicitly mentioned the bystander effect, so i kicked myself into gear
  - i dove into the spreadsheet, and categorized 39 synopses in 90 minues
    - and i found myself MENTALLY EXHAUSTED
    - most of the solutions were pretty shit, but one or two were fantastic
    - i found i got better and faster as I went on, as I started noticing patterns
      - and memorizing the major/minor ideas
  - as i went, I noticed that there were people helping with the doc, not only on dedup efforts
    - but people were curating the list of major/minor ideas
    - and writing cool new excell things
  - on average there were about 55 people working whenever i looked
  - in parallel, reddit was attempting to coordinate the whole system
    - which is a) pretty amazing because reddit is pretty fucking decentralized
    - there were meta-threads on solving the problem, discussing strategies on how to approach it
      - with solutions ranging from "here's how we should do it" to "here's the relevant literature on how we would organize this problem for computers to solve it"
    - and meta-meta-threads, discussing how to discuss solving the problem
      - a thread went up whose job was to create a trie for solutions, so you could at-a-glance check if something had already been submitted
    - additionally, threads went up on meta-gaming the system itself
      - on how to blackmail EY into giving us the good solution
      - etc
    - people started rereading the entire book, looking for and compiling a list of all foreshadowing that could possibly be useful
    - finally, there were threads of compiled lists of threads for tracking down any of the above

result: longer than the first 5 harry potter books combined
  - 2,000 reviews
  - 7800 hpmor subs
  - "On a larger scale, the verdict is in: your collective literary intelligence has exceeded mine. There were at least half a dozen brilliant ideas I'd never imagined."
  - http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xuzv9/my_biggest_takeaway_from_the_final_exam/
    - Since I've started reading HPMOR it became my goal to learn to write like EY, but I couldn't even begin to imagine how a person can come up with such complex and creative ideas.
